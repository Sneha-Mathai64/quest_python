PDB (Python Debugger)



python -m pdb <name>.py[args]     (begin the debugger)



help[command] view a list of commands, or view help for a specific
command



within a python file:
import pdb
...
pdb.set_trace() 
Add the above call to begin the debugger at this line when the file is run normally.



NAVIGATING CODE: (within the Pdb interpreter)
l(ist)     list 11 lines surrounding the current line
w(here)   display the file and line number of the current line
n(ext)     execute the current line
s(tep)     step into function called at the current line
r(eturn)   execute until the current function’s return is
encountered



CONTROLLING EXECUTION:
b[#]     create a breakpoint at line [#]
b       list breakpoints and their indices
c(ontinue)  execute until a breakpoint is encountered
clear[#]   clear breakpoint of index [#]



CHANGING VARIABLES / INTERACTING WITH CODE:
p<name>   print value of the variable <name>
!<expr>   execute the expression <expr>
NOTE: this acts just like a python interpreter
run[args]   restart the debugger with sys.argv arguments [args]
q(uit) exit the debugger
